## Nest data in treated area in 2014

The recent data set recieved on 9/23/2022 contains information about nest locations in treated areas.\
179 nest locations \

Questions\

Does this mean the nest was in a sandbar that was treated?\
If so, what is the proportion of the sandbar that was treated?\
Do we have information on whether the nest location was in a treated area in the sandbar?/
Does spray data from previously the same as the sandbar data from new data (note: the previous spray data only contain 2013 and 2014, but the sandbar data contain years 2014-2017).

## NOTES\

Data dictionary: out of 99 variables 24 variables are chosen (from both nest data and sand bar)\
For sandbar level analysis, we don’t really need the nest data. All the required data are already aggregated into sandbar level data. \
Sum_TOTSUC = Sum_NESTSU ?\
Sum_PIPL_A= Sum_TOTADU?\
Zero inflated (both successful nests and total nests). Proportion of successful nests doesn’t provide much information.\
